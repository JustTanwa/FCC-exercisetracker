# Exercise Tracker

This is the boilerplate for the Exercise Tracker project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/exercise-tracker


## Goal

The goal is to pass all the test cases as stated on the intructions page on FCC. I am completing this project to learn more about and practice using MongoDB Atlas and Express.

I will use express to handle different routing method such as GET and POST and respond with appropriate data taken from the data base.

The data will be stored in a cloud service, MongoDB, I will practice creating schema, using model to create documents. I will also use query parameter to fetch and update document.
